    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for\n",
    "partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subgroups or clusters. The\n",
    "goal of K-means is to group similar data points into clusters and minimize the\n",

    "Here's an overview of how K-means clustering works:\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "● Choose the number of clusters, K, that you want to form.\n",
    "● Randomly initialize K cluster centroids. Each centroid represents the\n",
    "mean of the data points in its cluster.\n",
    "Assignment Step:\n",
    "● Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance\n",
    "metric, commonly the Euclidean distance. This forms K clusters.\n",
    "Update Step:\n",
    "● Recalculate the centroids of the newly formed clusters by taking the\n",
    "mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "Repeat:\n",
    "● Repeat the assignment and update steps iteratively until convergence.\n",
    "Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly\n",

    "● The final result is K clusters, and each data point is assigned to one of\n",

    "making it versatile for various clustering tasks.\n",
    "Robustness:\n",
    "● K-means is robust to noisy data points and outliers, as it assigns them\n",

    "Proven Effectiveness:\n",
    "● Despite its simplicity, K-means often performs well in practice and is\n",
    "widely used in real-world applications.\n",
    "Limitations of K-means Clustering:\n",

    "hold true for all datasets.\n",
    "Hard Assignment of Data Points:\n",
